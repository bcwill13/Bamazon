<p>An Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.</p>
<p>Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.</p>
<p>The app should then prompt users with two messages.</p>
<p>The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.</p>
<p>The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.</p>
<p>Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.</p>
<p>If not, the app should log a phrase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through.</p>
<p>However, if your store does have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order.</p>
<p>This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.<p>

<p>npm install before running the app</p>
